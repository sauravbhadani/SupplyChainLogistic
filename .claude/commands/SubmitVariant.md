# /SubmitVariant

Submit a new variant or changes to an existing variant to the claude-workflow repository via a proper branching and pull request workflow. This command ensures contributions follow the repository's contribution guidelines.

## Purpose

Contribute your variants and improvements back to the community:
- Submit new variants you've created
- Propose updates to existing variants
- Fix bugs in variant components
- All contributions go through branches and PRs - never direct push to main

## Usage

```
/SubmitVariant <variant-name> [options]
```

## Arguments

- `variant-name`: The variant to submit (required)

## Options

- `--type`: Submission type: `new` | `update` | `fix` (default: auto-detect)
- `--title`: Custom PR title
- `--dry-run`: Preview what would be submitted without actually creating PR

## Submission Process

### 1. Pre-flight Checks

Before submission, the command verifies:
- Variant exists and passes validation
- GitHub CLI is authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- User has push access or can fork
- No uncommitted changes in variant directory

### 2. Validate Variant

Runs full validation:
```
Validating swift-ios...
  ✓ manifest.json valid
  ✓ All referenced files exist
  ✓ Markdown frontmatter valid
  ✓ Version format correct
  ✓ README.md present
```

### 3. Create Branch

Creates appropriately named branch:

| Submission Type | Branch Name |
|-----------------|-------------|
| New variant | `variant/{name}` |
| Update | `variant/{name}-update-YYYYMMDD` |
| Bug fix | `variant/{name}-fix-{description}` |

### 4. Stage and Commit

- Stages all variant files
- Creates descriptive commit message
- Shows diff summary for confirmation

### 5. Push and Create PR

- Pushes branch to origin (or fork)
- Creates pull request via GitHub CLI
- Includes variant summary in PR description
- Adds appropriate labels

## Examples

```bash
# Submit a new variant
/SubmitVariant swift-ios

# Submit update to existing variant
/SubmitVariant nextjs-development --type update

# Preview without submitting
/SubmitVariant swift-ios --dry-run

# Custom PR title
/SubmitVariant swift-ios --title "Add Swift iOS variant with SwiftUI support"
```

## Output

```

## Checklist

- [x] README.md included
- [x] All components documented
- [ ] Tested with sample project

## Test Instructions

1. Clone this PR branch
2. Run: `/SetupWorkflow /path/to/test --variant {variant-name}`
3. Verify setup completes successfully
```

## Handling Updates to Existing Variants

When submitting changes to variants in the main repository:

1. Ensure you're working with the latest main
2. Make your changes in the variant directory
3. Run `/SubmitVariant variant-name --type update`
4. Branch name includes date to avoid conflicts
5. PR describes what changed

## Fork Workflow

If you don't have push access to the main repository:

1. Command detects lack of push access
2. Offers to fork the repository
3. Creates branch on your fork
4. PR targets the upstream repository

```
You don't have push access to agdata-corp/claude-workflow.
Would you like to fork and submit from there? [Y/n]: y

Forking repository...
✓ Fork created: yourusername/claude-workflow

Creating PR to upstream...
```

## Safety Rules

This command enforces safe contribution practices:

1. **Never pushes to main** - Always creates feature branches
2. **Requires validation** - Won't submit invalid variants
3. **Requires clean state** - No uncommitted changes
4. **Descriptive commits** - Auto-generates meaningful commit messages
5. **PR review required** - All changes need maintainer approval

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Validation failed | Show errors, abort submission |
| Not authenticated | Prompt to run `gh auth login` |
| Branch exists | Offer to use existing or create new |
| Push rejected | Check permissions, suggest fork |
| PR creation failed | Show error, provide manual instructions |

- `/SetupWorkflow` - Test variant before submitting
- `/CheckMCPStatus` - Verify GitHub CLI status

## Tasks Invoked

- `variant-management.validate`
- `variant-management.prepareBranch`
- `variant-management.submitPullRequest`

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- Git configured with user.name and user.email
- Variant passes validation

## Notes

- First-time contributors may need to fork
- Maintainers review all PRs before merge
- Complex variants may require discussion before submission
- Consider opening an issue first for major new variants
